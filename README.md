This project utilized linear regression and ensembling to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. The Kaggle competition provided the datasets and problem definition. Several data manipulation steps were required to increase prediction accuracy.

There is still quite a bit of work available to be done and improvements are noted in the code documentation. Several Kaggle kernels have been referenced and have been used as motivation for how to approach this regression problem.
